<h1> Little Red Riding Hood </h1>
<h2> Charles Perrault </h2>

<p>
<pre>
Once upon a time there lived a little country girl, the prettiest 
creature who was ever seen. Her <font color="violet" size="12"><b>mother</font></b> had a little red 
riding hood made for her. Everybody called her <font color="violet" size="12"><b>Little Red 
Riding Hood.</font></b>

One day her <font color="violet" size="12"><b>mother</font></b> said to her: “Go my dear, and see how 
your <font color="violet" size="12"><b>grandmother</font></b> is doing, for I hear <font color="red" size="12"><sup>she has been very ill</font></sup>.”

<font color="violet" size="12"><b>Little Red Riding Hood</font></b> set out immediately.

As she was going through the <font color="green" size="12"><u>wood</font></u>, she met with a <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b>. He 
asked her where she was going.

“I am going to see my <font color="violet" size="12"><b>grandmother</font></b>.”

“Does she live far off?” said the <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b>.

“It is <font color="green" size="12"><u>beyond that mill</font></u> you see there”.

It was not long before the <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b> arrived at the <font color="green" size="12"><u>old woman’s 
house.</font></u> He knocked at the door.

Tap, tap, tap.

“Who’s there?”

“Your <font color="violet" size="12"><b>grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,</font></b>” replied the <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf,</font></b> 
faking her voice.

The good <font color="violet" size="12"><b>grandmother</font></b> called out, “Pull the string, and the 
latch will go up.”

The <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b> pulled the string and the door opened, and then he 
immediately fell upon the good woman and <font color="red" size="12"><sup>ate her up</font></sup> in a 
moment.

He then shut the door and got into the <font color="violet" size="12"><b>grandmother’s</font></b> bed, 
expecting <font color="violet" size="12"><b>Little Red Riding Hood</font></b>, who came some time 
afterwards and knocked at the door.

Tap, tap, tap.

“Who’s there?”

“It is your <font color="violet" size="12"><b>grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood.</font></b>”

The <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b> cried out, “Pull the string, and the latch will go up.”

<font color="violet" size="12"><b>Little Red Riding Hood</font></b> pulled the string, and the door opened.

“<font color="violet" size="12"><b>Grandmother</font></b>, what big arms you have!”

“All the better to hug you with, my dear.”

“<font color="violet" size="12"><b>Grandmother</font></b>, what big ears you have!”

“All the better to hear you with, my child.”

“<font color="violet" size="12"><b>Grandmother</font></b>, what big eyes you have!”

“All the better to see you with, my child.”

“<font color="violet" size="12"><b>Grandmother</font></b>, what big teeth you have got!”

“All the better to <font color="red" size="12"><sup>eat you up</font></sup> with.”

 
Fortunately, a <font color="violet" size="12"><b>hunter</font></b> was passing near by the <font color="green" size="12"><u>hut</font></u>. He heard 
the <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b>, and recognised him right away. He ran over to the 
<font color="green" size="12"><u>window</font></u>. <font color="blue" size="12"><sub>He took a good aim, and that was the end of the <font color="violet" size="12"><b>wolf</font></b>.
